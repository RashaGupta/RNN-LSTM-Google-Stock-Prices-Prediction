# RNN-LSTM-Google-Stock-Prices-Prediction
This is a Recurrent Neural Network LSTM project, wherein we are predicting 2017 Google stock prices, given a dataset of 2012-2016 stock prices of the company. Completed using TensorFlow, Keras, and other Python libraries.

## Loss (MSE): 0.0016

## Details:
In this project we will create a Recurrent Neural Network model using LSTM layers with Dropout Regularization implemented, to predict stock prices of Google in 2017.

The dataset is Google Stock Prices taken over a 5 year period (2012-2016)

The project has been completed using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, and other essential python libraries.

Many thanks, Rachana
